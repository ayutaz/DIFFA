**DIFFA** is the **first diffusion-based large audio-language model (LALM)** for spoken language understanding.  
It leverages a frozen diffusion LLM with **dual adapters** (semantic + acoustic) to enhance **audio perception and reasoning**.  
As the first exploration of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) in speech and audio understanding, DIFFA opens new directions for non-autoregressive multimodal learning.
This repository provides the training data, checkpoints, inference scripts, and reproducible training pipelines to facilitate further research on diffusion LLMs in the audio domain.

## 🚀 Overview
Despite using only **960h ASR** and **127h synthetic instruction data**, DIFFA achieves competitive results compared to models trained on **hundreds of thousands of hours**.

## ⚙️ Setup

### Python Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git
cd DIFFA
conda create -n diffa python=3.10
conda activate diffa
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Checkpoints

Please download and set up the following models:

* [LLaDA-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Instruct)
* [Whisper-Small](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small)
* [DIFFA checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/zhoujiaming777/DIFFA)

Update `llm_path`, `whisper_path`, and `model_path` in the inference scripts before running.

---

## 🔍 Inference

We provide inference code for the following benchmarks:

* [MMSU](https://github.com/dingdongwang/mmsu_bench)
* [MMAU](https://github.com/Sakshi113/MMAU)
* [VoiceBench](https://github.com/MatthewCYM/VoiceBench)

Example (MMSU):

```bash
bash run_mmsu_inference.sh
```

After inference, run `evaluate.py` for each benchmark to compute final metrics.

## ⚠️ Note on Inference Speed

Currently, DIFFA’s inference is slower than autoregressive audio-language models. This is mainly because its backbone **LLaDA** has not yet been optimized for efficiency. In particular, diffusion-based LLMs lack KV-cache support and parallel decoding, which makes decoding slower compared to autoregressive models. Since this work is the *first exploration* of diffusion LLMs in the audio domain, our focus is on **evaluating performance** rather than optimizing speed. If you are interested in acceleration, we recommend looking into recent training-free methods such as [Fast-dLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22618), which report **27.6× faster inference** and represent a promising direction for future integration.

## 📖 Training

We provide training scripts for reimplementation.

### Data Preparation

* **Stage 1**: [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12)
* **Stage 2**: VoxCeleb1, AccentDB, IEMOCAP, DailyTalk, VCTK-Corpus

Data format and indices are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zhoujiaming777/DIFFA).

### Training Script

```bash
# Stage 1
bash train_stage1.sh

# Stage 2
bash train_stage2.sh
```
